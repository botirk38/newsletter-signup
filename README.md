### What I learned

I learned a lot about form validation and the importance of user feedback during this project. Managing form state and errors can be complex in a larger form, but for this single field form, it was a good exercise.

I implemented email validation with a simple regular expression:

```js
const validateEmail = (email) => {
  const regex = /\S+@\S+\.\S+/;
  return regex.test(email);
}
